This Application is made through Flask. So please ensure you know how to create a flask app(YouTube).

I have uploaded the static & templates folder for the front-end UI design.

All the Python code remains in the main.py file.

Have your AWS, MongoDb & Message91 Auth Keys in hand for ease implementation.

After you create your flask App, just paste the files in their respective destinations.

Note: The '//tmp' is used to store files temporarily on the Google Cloud Platform. If running locally, please remove these.

Get in touch for any help :) Happy Coding!
